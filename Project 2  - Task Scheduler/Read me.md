The code is a **console-based task management system**. It's a clean and simple to-do list app that prioritizes tasks based on their **deadline** using a `PriorityQueue`. Here's a quick breakdown of what you've written and what it does:

---

### 📝 **Purpose & Functionality:**
It's designed to **help users track and prioritize tasks**. You’ve used Java’s `PriorityQueue` and `LocalDate` to organize and display tasks by their deadlines.

### 🔧 **Main Components:**

#### 1. **`Task` Class:**
- Represents a single task with:
  - `description` (e.g., "Buy Groceries")
  - `deadline` (e.g., 2025-04-19)
- Overrides `toString()` to nicely format the task for display.

#### 2. **Main Method (`main`)**
- Initializes a `PriorityQueue<Task>` that sorts tasks by their deadlines.
- Adds a few example tasks to the queue.
- Runs a loop with three user options:

### 📋 **Menu Options:**

1. **View Today’s Tasks**
   - Shows tasks that are due **on today’s date** using `LocalDate.now()`.

2. **View All Upcoming Tasks**
   - Displays **all tasks** from the queue in order of deadlines.
   - Uses a temporary copy of the queue so original task list remains unchanged.

3. **Exit**
   - Exits the program with a farewell message.
